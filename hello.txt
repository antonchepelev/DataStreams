Hello Professor,

My name is Anton, and I am in your class.
I am enjoying this class very much.
My mom named me Anton because she liked the name.
I also like programming in Java.
Sometimes I struggle with Streams and Collections.
But practice makes perfect.
I hope to learn a lot from this course.
Do you have any tips for filtering text efficiently?
Thank you for your guidance.
